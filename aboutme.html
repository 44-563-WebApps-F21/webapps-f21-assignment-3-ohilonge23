<h3>New Algorithm</h3>

<blockquote cite=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String-searching_algorithm”> In computer science, string-searching algorithms, sometimes called string-matching algorithms, are an important class of string algorithms that try to find a place where one or several strings (also called patterns) are found within a larger string or text. </blockquote >

        const int m = 1e9 + 9;

        long long p_pow = 1;
        for (char c : s) {
            hash_value = (hash_value + (c - 'a' + 1) * p_pow) % m;
